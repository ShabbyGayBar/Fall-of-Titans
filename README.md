# AttackOnTitan

A Victoria 3 mod that takes place in the world of _Attack on Titan_ (Shingeki no Kyojin). Starting in the year 832, when Grisha Yeager and other members of the Eldian Restorationists were sent to _exile_ on the island of Paradis.

Three major factions are present in the game:
- Marley:
  - The nation of Marley is a militaristic and imperialistic nation that has oppressed the Eldians for centuries. They are the main antagonists of the series.
  - In the game, their objective is to maintain their dominance over all other great powers, even by obtaining the power of the founding titan at the risk of activating the _rumbling_, while at the same time trying to catch up in technology to cope with warfare of the next generation.
- Eldia (or Paradis at game-start):
  - The isolationist regime of Paradis Island, exiled from the mainland for over a century, is tightly constrained by the walls that protect them from the titans outside. But the walls won't hold forever, and when they breach, what comes with the titans is the truth of the world outside.
  - The objective of the Eldian nation is subject to the player's choice. They can either choose to modernize and try to get a say on the world stage, or they can choose to embrace the titan powers and try to destroy the rest of the world. But either way, the player will have to break free of the royal bloodline's control first.
- The rest of the world:
  - With the threat of the titans looming over, countries that don't have the titan powers will have to either destroy those who do or find a way to survive the apocalyptic _rumbling_, both of which require advanced technology, making it the most challenging path compared to the other two factions.
